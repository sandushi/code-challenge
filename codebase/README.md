### Note
-  Balance are calculated by sum up the due charges.
-  If the balance > 0 -> that means the account holder needs to pay the money
-  If the balance = 0 -> that means all the due charges are setttled up
-  If the balance < 0 -> that means the account has some credit

### Front end functionalities

- All the accounts are loadded in the accounts tab.
- The accounts can be filtered by the type and the address.
- The balance amount is shown in red ( credit), green (due charges) and grey (settled).
- The payment can be done for each account by clicking on the payment button.
- Enter the amount willing to pay and the credit card details on the pop up modal. (The Pay button is disabled until the user enter the details)
- If the card is expired, there is a error message on the modal and unable to do the payment.
- The length valiations are added to the card number and the cvv.
- After a successful payment, the `Payment Successful` alert will be triggered.
- The account balance is changed according to the amount paid for that account.
- The payment history can be checked by the `Payment History` tab.

- Inhance the UI with better user experience
- Improve error states
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger for the backend
